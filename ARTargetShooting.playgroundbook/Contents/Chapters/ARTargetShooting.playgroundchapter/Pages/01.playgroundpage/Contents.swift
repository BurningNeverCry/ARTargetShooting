 # ARTargetShooting
 Hi! I'm **Kuixi Song**, a junior student majored in Software Engineering from Nanjing University, China. I've devoted in iOS development since last year and this year, I made some digging into the newest `ARKit`, which is awesome and easy to use! So I created a little target shooting game for WWDC 2018 scholarship submission. Hope you like it! ðŸ˜Š
 
 ## How to play
 After tapping the `Run my code` button, move your iPad around to initialize the `ARKit`. Once done, some targets will show up in the screen randomly. Try to find them, use the front sight (in the center of screen) to aim at these targets, and tap the screen to shoot them down!
 
 ## Notice
 * If you can not find any target, try rerun the code or take a look around you.
 * Targets in different colors represent different scores. Be sure to shoot the right target!
 
 ![1 point](target-normal.png "1 point") 1 point
 
 ![3 point](target-high.png "3 point") 3 points
 
 ![-5 point](target-demon.png "-5 point") -5 points
 
 Good luck!
